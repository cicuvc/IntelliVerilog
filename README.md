# IntelliVerilog

The IntelliVerilog is an **hardware description language** based on C#.

IntelliVerilog add no new language features to pure C# but provide
expressiveness of a modern prorgamming language to achieve full-
parameterizable circuit generation and produce synthesizable Verilog.

IntelliVerilog is NOT high-level synthesis (HLS) language. IntelliVerilog 
provides a full-level control of timing, piplining, intermediate value evaluation
and register transition, and generates human-readable Verilog/VHDL code.
